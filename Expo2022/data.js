The hybrid approach to this animation can assist in positively impacting the cognitive development in children, allowing us to teach them important life skills and topics such as empathy, by bringing the pages from a storybook to life through the use of handmade puppets and objects to create an aesthetic similar to that of a children’s book.","youtube":"https://player.vimeo.com/video/728702227?h=94b05a28ca","modalName":"stan_and_sven_a_plan_to_help_stan","heroImage":"./img/hero/stan_and_sven_a_plan_to_help_stan.jpeg","headImage":"./img/head/Amber Stacey.jpeg"},{"studNo":"s3940165","author":"Cécile Robert","emailAddress":"s3940165@student.rmit.edu.au","category":"Animation","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/cecilerobert78","personalSite":"https://cecile-robert.com","headImageOriginal":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1BlL9agmNWRXFvAspf1IFnBHGJTBfMtvY","bio":"Cécile is a Melbourne-based 2d animator.

Ultimately, my hope is to contribute to the cultivation of a more playful society and so I feel I must lead by example. It is not enough to just make playful works, the work needs to be made in a manner that embodies play itself. To me that means creating work that is loving and compassionate, looking for any and all opportunities to create moments of joy that can be shared with my community.","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kd0zhdtQxHg","relevantImageOne":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1mBbhwTlRfvOuKULHlBOAGpynyQZIbMhZ","modalName":"a_p_d_responses","heroImage":"./img/hero/a_p_d_responses.jpeg","headImage":"./img/head/Duncan Corrigan.jpeg"},{"studNo":"s3921402","author":"Duncan Corrigan","emailAddress":"duncancorrigandesign@gmail.com","category":"Games","twitter":"https://twitter.com/DuncanCorrigan","personalSite":"https://duncancorrigan.squarespace.com/","headImageOriginal":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=191yFengtx5zKMVxW9ZPgcrxgxGfKJKH3","bio":"Duncan is a game designer with an interest in creating expressive games that inspire playfulness.

GRASPING aims to employ elements such as novelty, horror and connection to inspire playfulness while leaning away from the common aesthetics associated with play. With this approach I hope to help promote the radical plasticity of play (Boluk & LeMieux, 2018) and clearly reify some mechanisms and techniques that can help inspire playful engagement. \nGRASPING uses a novel controller with horror elements that requires a participant to place their entire forearm into a foreboding device.

Despite this growth in a dark comedy directed at adults, there are few examples of these animated works that connect with the lateral, surreal, and absurd, narratives of the dream state. For example, the animated series “12 Oz Mouse”, employs a surreal format, and the storyline develops from absurdist comedy. “Before is over” brings together a surreal tone with the narrative sensibilities drawn from absurdist comedy, to create mystery and thrill.\n\nSurrealism is conveyed in a few ways. Firstly, the bird world with anthropomorphized characters, which is built for this animation is partly surreal. Those characters exist in between human and bird reality. For example, the flat of the main character Lo looks like a nest, the characters speak the bird langua  dream state. It is difficult to distinguish reality from a dream sequence. It creates confusion but also coherence by creating a surreal context where weird things can happen without too much need for a logical cause of a traditional narrative. This effect is conveyed, for example, through unrealistic non-linear transitions from one scene to another such as sucking into the phone or wine flooding in the club. \n\nComedy develops not through overtly directed jokes but through surreal unexpected moments. Some absurd moments are both funny and dramatic, such as shooting at the protagonist with aggressive cats. The surreal approach allows the comedy to arise through such unpredicted scenes. And through such moments, allows us to engage with the universalities of love/longing/want through a different lens, giving us a new view into familiar experiences.","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ftnGU4CU4a8","relevantImageOne":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=169t3kUKyM3Vr-C0c_3j-Si8h1My1vaPT","modalName":"before_is_over","heroImage":"./img/hero/before_is_over.jpeg","headImage":"./img/head/Yana Fidan.jpeg"},{"studNo":"s3939767","author":"Yana Fidan","emailAddress":"s3939767@student.rmit.edu.au","category":"Animation","instagram":"https://instagram.com/yana_fidan?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=","behance":"https://magistudio.net/works?author=278","personalSite":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1io4xFHaFt4yn-xkPPdbpx7Df0O9ZfbZr","headImageOriginal":"https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1DyyMhNjF6paQ0uVQVxd2le2yMWC7mEqL","bio":"Yana is a 2D animator based in Melbourne.
